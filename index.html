								<h2>Who we are</h2>
								<p>The Dove Assembly provides a progressive bilingual English/Italian education for 4-7 year olds. Located in the Italian countryside, it's a place where children escape the ordinary and experience a hands-on education surrounded by nature. Here, children are encouraged to embrace curiosity, explore their interests and think critically, whilst connecting with the natural world around them. </p>
								<p>The Dove Assembly was founded to connect the principles of nature-based learning with the relevance of a modern curriculum, fostering a holistic educational experience that blends both worlds.</p>

								<span class="icon style2 major solid fa-seedling"></span>
								<h3>The location</h3>
								<p> We are fortunate enough to be located on organic farmland set within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Assisi, nestled between an olive grove, an orchard and a vegetable garden. From the rolling Umbrian hills, to the lush forests surrounding us, every day, on our doorstep, we use nature as our classroom to explore and learn. As our students search this picturesque landscape, they’ll learn to develop a deep appreciation for the beauty that surrounds them.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon style2 major solid fa-book"></span>
								<h3>A progressive curriculum</h3>
								<p>We merge two seemingly disparate worlds: the natural environment and the cutting-edge world of technology. This unique balance empowers students to become well-rounded, forward-thinking individuals who can navigate the complexities of modern life with an understanding of both the natural world and the digital landscape, preparing them for success in an ever-changing society.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon style2 major solid fa-graduation-cap"></span>
								<h3>Expert teachers</h3>
								<p>Our teachers are dedicated and passionate educators, who all bring unique experiences and teaching styles. With smaller class sizes, our teachers have more opportunities to form meaningful connections with our students, understanding their individual needs, strengths, and learning preferences. They focus on experiential learning, where teachers guide students through hands-on activities and outdoor experiences that foster a deep connection to the environment.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon style2 major solid fa-laptop-code"></span>
								<h3>A holistic approach</h3>
								<p>Beyond academics, we place a strong emphasis on nurturing the whole child by focusing on emotional intelligence, mindfulness and community building. We recognise that a well-rounded education goes beyond traditional subjects, and we strive to equip students with the emotional awareness and self-regulation skills that are essential for personal growth and meaningful relationships.</p>

						<h2>What we teach</h2>
						<p>We have a strong focus on academic subjects. Each day, our students will engage in dedicated maths and literacy lessons, designed to build a strong foundation in both subjects through interactive and personalised learning. In addition to core subjects like history, art, science, and music, we also offer a diverse range of other subjects designed to foster curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking. Below is a selection of the subjects and experiences we provide to enrich our students' learning journeys:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Robotics</li>
							<li>Organic gardening</li>

									<h3>A Day in the Life</h3>
								</header>
								<dl>
									<dt>09:00</dt>
									<dd>
										<p><strong>Morning gathering:</strong> The day starts with circle time, where students and teachers gather to set the tone for the day. Everyone shares a thought or feeling, helping children to connect emotionally and mentally. Each child is assigned a task they are responsible for that day, for example being in charge of laying the table for lunch, or being responsible for feeding the hens.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>09:30</dt>
									<dd>
										<p><strong>Current theme:</strong> The first lesson of the day takes us to the vegetable garden, where we dive into our current theme: bees. Today, we are focused on exploring the structure of a bee hive, examining the shapes, textures, and construction methods. As we observe closely, we learn about their intricate design and how a bee colony works together in harmony to support the hive. After our exploration, we are given a creative challenge: to search for natural materials we believe would be ideal for constructing our own bee hive, applying what we've learned in a hands-on, practical way.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>10:00</dt>
									<dd>
										<p><strong>Snack and free play:</strong> Around this time we break for a snack, prepared where possible using seasonal, local ingredients from the land around us. The children are then free to play and explore, with the outdoor space usually being transformed into an imaginative petrol pump for the queuing trikes, or a pop-up cafe in the mud kitchen.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>10:30</dt>
									<dd>
										<p><strong>Mathematics:</strong> Today our maths lesson is focused on odd/even numbers and doubling/halving. With the use of games and objects from the outdoors, the lesson is interactive to help us build a strong foundation for number sense in a playful way.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>11:30</dt>
									<dd>
										<p><strong>Personalised learning time:</strong> In this session, we are able to choose activities that match our interests—whether it’s reading, problem-solving, or creative arts. Our teachers guide students in their chosen activities, providing support when needed and allowing for self-paced exploration.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>12:00</dt>
									<dd>
										<p><strong>Lunch and play:</strong> Lunch is served in a relaxed, communal setting. We see what the weather is doing each day and choose whether we want to eat outdoors or not. Whoever has been assigned as responsible for lunchtime setup will take charge and prepare the table, but everyone helps. We all eat the fresh, seasonal lunch together, which more often than not uses ingredients from our organic vegetable garden. Everyone helps to clear up afterwards, before we go off to play.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>13:30</dt>
									<dd>
										<p><strong>Literacy:</strong> We begin the lesson in the shade, gathering together to read stories. Today’s focus is on phonics, and we are exploring different letter sounds in the world around us. Throughout the lesson, we also have the opportunity to work individually with the teacher, practicing our reading skills one-on-one to receive personalised support and guidance.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>14:30</dt>
									<dd>
										<p><strong>Creative arts:</strong> Now it’s time to use the materials we gathered this morning to construct our own bee hives. There are a variety of natural resources provided — twigs, leaves, clay, and more, allowing us to creatively design and build a hive inspired by the structures we studied earlier in the day.</p>
									</dd>
									<dt>15:00</dt>
									<dd>
										<p><strong>Closing reflection:</strong> The day wraps up with a closing circle where we reflect on what we've learned, share our experiences, and set intentions for tomorrow. This helps us to process our learning and express our feelings, leaving the school day with a sense of accomplishment and connection.</p>

								<h2>Our team</h2>
								<p>Our team consists of passionate educators with experience in alternative education methodologies. Each member plays a vital role in fostering a dynamic and supportive learning environment, bringing a wealth of knowledge and experience to guide students through a holistic, nature-based education. Their dedication and expertise are fundamental to creating a nurturing atmosphere where every child can thrive, explore, and grow both academically and personally.
								</br></br>
								One of the founders is a seasoned software engineer with experience teaching coding to young women at esteemed institutions like LSE, City University, and UCL. She firmly believes that children should grasp the fundamental concepts of how computers work, and that this can be achieved without the need for screen time. Drawing on her experience with languages, she advocates for early exposure to these concepts, believing it to be crucial for making learning intuitive and effortless. Her approach emphasises a hands-on, screen-free exploration of technology to foster curiosity and foundational understanding from a young age.</p>

								<h4><strong>How many pupils are in each class?</strong></h4>
								<p>Each class consists of a maximum of 14 children, giving a maximum student to teacher ratio of 7:1.</p>

								<h4><strong>What is the admissions process?</strong></h4>
								<p>To ensure we are a fit for each other, the first step in our admissions process is to have a call and get to know the family. To request a call, <a href="mailto:admissions@doveassembly.com">please contact our admissions team here</a>. Provided you would like to proceed, you will be sent an official offer letter, via email, for you to complete and return along with a holding deposit (1 term's payment). We also ask that you fill out our questionnaire, so we can better get to know your child and their individual needs. Please note that we cannot hold your child a place until their holding deposit has been received.</p>

								<h4><strong>Do you provide meals and snacks for the children?</strong></h4>
								<p>All meals and snacks are prepared by our team. We use seasonal, local, organic produce where possible. We also leverage the insights of a nutritionist to ensure each meal is balanced and able to provide the necessary fuel for our students. We like to keep things as natural as possible in all aspects of the school, and that extends to the kitchen too. We like to cook with cast iron or stainless steel, and you won't find plastic chopping boards in our kitchen.</p>

								<h4><strong>What language are the lessons taught in?</strong></h4>
								<p>Classes are taught in both English and Italian. We try to make this an even divide throughout the day, but naturally some weeks will be heavier on English, and others Italian.</p>

								<h4><strong>Is there a school uniform?</strong></h4>
								<p>No. Students are free to wear what they feel most comfortable in.</p>

								<h4><strong>Can parents join the sessions?</strong></h4>
								<p>We invite parents in for certain occasions, but on a day-to-day basis parents cannot join the classes.</p>
